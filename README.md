terrible tf_port/live tf2 leak code frankenstein, as of writing the major additions are TFBots and the Payload gamemode, w/ some other smaller changes like autoreload and combattext/hitsounds

## Building

### For VS2022:

Install "MSVC v140 - VS 2015 C++ build tools" and "C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017" from Visual Studio Installer

Run the createtfmod.bat file and open the newly created "games" solution
