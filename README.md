Team Fortress 2: Gold Rush
=====

damn, another tf2 soucremod...

You could call this a tf_port ""plus"", as of writing the major additions are TFBots and the Payload gamemode, w/ some other smaller changes like autoreload and combattext/hitsounds

The loadout panels are WIP, and econ (item system) itself isn't here (yet)

## Building

### For VS2022:

Install "MSVC v140 - VS 2015 C++ build tools" and "C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017" from Visual Studio Installer

Run the createtfmod.bat file and open the newly created "games" solution

(you can also just use VS2015 if you want)
