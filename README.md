*damn, another tf2 soucremod...*

Building Team Fortress 2 back to its true golden age (2007-2009), update by update, while maintaining the gameâ€™s original air and timbre. Immersion and QoL features are priority, *not* custom content.

## Building

### For VS2022:

Install "MSVC v140 - VS 2015 C++ build tools" and "C++ Windows XP Support for VS 2017" from Visual Studio Installer

Run the createtfmod.bat file and open the newly created "games" solution

\
(you can also just use VS2015 if you want)
